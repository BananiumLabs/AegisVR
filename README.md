## General Disclaimer
We are not experts in self-defense and don't claim to be. This is simply a student project aiming to spread awareness about personal safety in the event of an assault. However, there are some things here that everyone should consider.

The primary focus of self-defense is not to win the fight, but to hurt your opponent enough for you to escape. If you're faced with a possible dangerous situation, your first instinct should be de escalation and you should attempt to remove yourself from the area, while remaining alert to threats. If you are faced with an assault and have no escape, make as much noise as you can to attract attention and use principles taught by experienced self-defense instructors.
