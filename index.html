                The primary focus of self-defense is not to win the fight, but to hurt your opponent enough for you to escape. If
                you're faced with a possible dangerous situation, your first instinct should be de escalation and you should attempt to
                remove yourself from the area, while remaining alert to threats. If you are faced with an assault and have no escape,
                make as much noise as you can to attract attention and use principles taught by experienced self-defense instructors.

                you can in order to deny them use of that limb. Then, when they are exposed, go for an easily accessible pressure
                point. You can also use their energy against them, punishing their advance with an attack of your own.</p>

                <h3 class="center-text">Gun Defense</h3>
                <p class="center-text">&emsp;Guns are rarely used at close range, but one is put against your head, you have a chance of escaping it. A fact you
                must realize is that once you touch the gun at all, it will go off. So, the best strategy is to first get yourself out
                of the gun's line of fire. The best direction would be up , but left and right can work too (go in the direction
                opposite your dominant hand). Move while grabbing the gun with both hands.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;After the gun has fired, or when it's already been raised, push into your opponent's body and take yank the gun away
                from their hand, putting as much pressure on their arm(s) as you can. After you yank the gun way, put distance between
                yourself and your assailant while chambering a new round into the barrel to be ready to fire if necessary. Increase
                distance and run if there is an escape route available.
                <br><br>

                <h3 class="center-text">Knife Defense</h3>
                <p class="center-text">
                &emsp; Knives are very dangerous in close quarters situations, even more so than guns. Part of that danger is their ability to
                be concealed and used very quickly. In fact, most victims don't even see the knife during the attack and only realize
                they've been stabbed after the assault ended. Due to this potential danger it is very important to watch the hands of
                any suspicious people around you, in case they may be carrying a blade.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; If you manage to see a knife, do your best to dodge the knife and grab the arm holding the knife. After that, push into
                your opponent's body and either take their arm over your shoulder to deny them its use and get them to drop the knife,
                or hit their elbow in order to get them to release the knife due to the instant surge of pressure. After the knife is
                dropped, throw or kick it away to buy you time for when you run in the opposite direction.
